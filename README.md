# Housing-prices-prediction-kaggle
 Predicts housing prices with advanced regression techniques

Below is a checklist of things to do in this project: (Current progress: almost done with exploratory data analysis as of 27th Oct)
1. Basic data cleaning and feature exploration
   - Checking out percentage of missing values and possible explanations behind it
   - Summary statistics of features
   - Separation of categorical and numerical features
   - As we progress, I found out certain features are numerical, but act as categorical, which will be dealt with later on.
     
2. Exploratory data analysis (looking at the relationships between features and target variable)
   - Checking out the distribution of target variable ('SalePrice')
   - Applying log transformation to normalize its distribution
   - Checking out the relationships between certain features and our target variable
     
3. Data Engineering (Building pipelines that automate data preprocessing on both training and test datasets)
4. Deploying baseline machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
5. Feature engineering, trying to improve our models
6. Ensembling
